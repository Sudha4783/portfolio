high temperature, or poor air quality.

## Proposed Solution
An IoT-based automatic window control system that opens or closes
windows based on environmental sensor data.

## Technologies Planned
- Rain Sensor
- Temperature / Gas Sensor
- Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32)
- Motor Control

## Expected Outcome
Improved comfort and safety through automated window operation.

## Project Status
