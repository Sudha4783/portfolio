# Smart Irrigation System (DTI Project)

## Project Type
Design Thinking & Innovation (DTI)

## Problem Statement
Traditional irrigation systems waste water due to manual control
and lack of real-time monitoring.

## Proposed Solution
An IoT-based smart irrigation system that automatically controls
water supply based on soil moisture and environmental conditions.

## Technologies Planned
- IoT Sensors (Soil Moisture, Temperature)
- Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32)
- IoT Platform
- Basic Web or Mobile Interface

## Expected Outcome
Efficient water usage and automated irrigation with minimal human
intervention.

## Project Status
📌 Planning / Learning Stage
